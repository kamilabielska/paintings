# paintings
Classification of the paintings from [*Best Artworks of All Time*](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time) dataset. The purpose of this project is to build a model which can predict who of the 50 painters is the author of the given painting.

Additionaly, a Dash app was created, which enables you to [play a game against the neural network](https://who-painted-that.herokuapp.com/): who is better at guessing the authors of the paintings? There, for now, a subset of 12 artists is taken into account. (The app is hosted on heroku and may take around 30-60s to load.)
